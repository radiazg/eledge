str_field_fieldname=Field Name
str_field_description=Description
str_field_value=Value
str_iname=Item Name:
str_explain_name=The name of the item is the name that is used internally by the database. Hence, once this name is set, you cannot change it. Additionally, this name will show up next to the text or check box describing the item when you edit a particular page. This name must be one word, unique and may contain underscores but no other punctuation marks
str_itype=Item Type:
str_explain_type=This field determines the "type" of the item, ie. checkbox (the user selects whether they want the item on the page or not, and doesn't have to fill in any values) or input (the user provides page specific information via a text box. By leaving the text box blank, the user shows that he/she doesn't want that particular item to be used on the page.
str_iloc=Page Location:
str_explain_loc=The page location determines the overall location of the item. Currently, supported locations are "top", "bottom", and "between paragraph" (ie: between content paragraphs). More fine-grained location determination will take place later in this wizard.

str_field_secpos=Section Position
str_explain_secpos=The Section Position defines the order in which the items will appear within a give page location. For instance, if items 1, 3, and 5 were all top of the page items, 1 would appear first, then 3, and then five. The number you select here is the number before which you want the new item to appear. For example, if items 1, 3, and 5 were in the drop box, and you wanted this item to be after 3, but before 5, you would select 5. If you want it after all of the items listed here, select End.
str_itext=HTML Text:
str_explain_pretext_cb=Html text is the actual html code that will be placed on a page if the user checks the checkbox for this particular item. For instance, if this was an image/border item, this would be the place to insert the &lt;img src=...&gt; code.
str_ipretext=HTML PreText:
str_explain_pretext_input=Html PreText is the html code that will be placed in the actual content page right before any user inputted or page specific value for the page. For instance, if this particular item was a link, the pretext would contain the &lt;a href=' portion of the link.
str_iposttext=HTML PostText:
str_explain_posttext=Html PostText is similar to html PreText. he difference is that the PostText is the html code that will follow any user defined (ie page specific) values. Going along with the previous example of a link, the PostText would look something like: '&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that each template item may only contain ONE user defined value. If, for something like a link, two values are needed, the solution is to create two template items: one for the actual link, and one for the link text.
str_idefault=Default Value
str_explain_default1=The default value allows you to set a default state or value for the item.&nbsp;
str_explain_default2=This can be checked, or unchecked. If it is checked, then a newly created content page will, by default, use this item.
str_explain_default3=This is the text that will show up in the input box for this item in a newly created content page. For instance, if this item were the main page header, where the PreText was &lt;h1&gt; and the PostText was &lt;/h1&gt;, a suitable default value might be: INSERT HEADING HERE or Main Heading.
